FFMpeg Poweramp changes and building

#define REDUCED_AUDIO_BUILD
This enables partial build of ffmpeg:
- various video APIs disabled (including structures changes, this makes ffmpeg .so not binary compatible)
- some unnecessary static data and calculations are skept
- some codec parts are disabled
- image processing removed

#define REDUCED_TAGS_BUILD
- unnecessary tag parsing is disabled

Build process.

$ export ANDROID_NDK=your ndk dir (android-r10e+)
$ cd audioplayer_ffmpeg_swresample/jni
$ ./build-neon.sh
$ cd ../../jni
$ ./build-neon.sh

Poweramp has "overriden" c/S files in /jni. Still, .h files can't be overriden this way, thus, they are kept both in jni and should be copied over the ffmpeg tree
FFmpeg configure basically works as intended, except external libraries detection (doesn't work currently, no pkg-config in ndk and/or it seems that crosscompile libs
not necessarily easily configured this way anyway). External library config variables are enabled in per-build config scripts (config.h/config.mak from config-pamp.h/config-pamp.mak).

- mp3 - benifits from local O3 by realtime .3%
- aac - no dif
